programs in different languages:\n python TBD  Python You can easily print a hello-world in Python by directly adding the following on a main.py file.\nprint(\u0026quot;Hello, World!\u0026quot;)  Execution:\n$ python main.py  Preventing side-effects You may have notice that the usage of the main.py python script as a module also triggers the hello-world statement.\nimport main # This unintentonally prints the 'Hello, World!' string # ...  Adding the following validation prevents printing the hello-world side-effect on imports:\nif __name__ == \u0026quot;__main__\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Hello, World!\u0026quot;)  Notice that the code still prints the \u0026lsquo;Hello, World!\u0026rsquo; when running:\npython main.py  Reusability By now, we know how to execute the hello-world program and avoid any side-effects when using it as a module. Let\u0026rsquo;s refactor the code so that we can re-utilize the hello-world implementation on different appliccations:\ndef hello_world(): print(\u0026quot;Hello, World!\u0026quot;) if __name__ == \u0026quot;__main__\u0026quot;: hello_world()  By implementing the hello_world function, we can now use this implementation in different scripts by importing the definition:\nfrom main import hello_world # Import without side-effects # ...  Parametrization We can parametrize the hello_world function so that we can select an arbitrary name.\ndef hello_world(name: str): print(f\u0026quot;Hello, {name}!\u0026quot;) if __name__ == \u0026quot;__main__\u0026quot;: hello_world(name=\u0026quot;World\u0026quot;)  Default parameters We can now define a default parameter to make the argument optional.\nfrom typing import Optional def hello_world(name: Optional[str] = None): name = name or \u0026quot;World\u0026quot; print(f\u0026quot;Hello, {name}!\u0026quot;) if __name__ == \u0026quot;__main__\u0026quot;: hello_world()  Default Configurable parameters import os from typing import Optional DEFAULT_WORLD = os.environ.get( \u0026quot;DEFAULT_WORLD\u0026quot;, default=\u0026quot;World\u0026quot; ) def hello_world(name: Optional[str] = None): name = name or DEFAULT_WORLD print(f\u0026quot;Hello, {name}!\u0026quot;) if __name__ == \u0026quot;__main__\u0026quot;: hello_world()  This allows us to change the default argument value:\n$ python main.py  $ DEFAULT_WORLS=example python main.py  Commandline arguments import argparse import os from typing import Optional DEFAULT_WORLD = os.environ.get( \u0026quot;DEFAULT_WORLD\u0026quot;, default=\u0026quot;World\u0026quot; ) def hello_world(name: Optional[str] = None): name = name or DEFAULT_WORLD print(f\u0026quot;Hello, {name}!\u0026quot;) if __name__ == \u0026quot;__main__\u0026quot;: # Instance argument parser, configure and retrieve arguments parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\u0026quot;Hello World Program\u0026quot;) parser.add_argument(\u0026quot;--world\u0026quot;, default=DEFAULT_WORLD) args = parser.parse_args() # Execute hello-world hello_world(name=args.world)  ","date":1645394072,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645395390,"objectID":"3f289ad9deff50f67a8232b628d934fb","permalink":"/post/hello-world/","publishdate":"2022-02-20T21:54:32Z","relpermalink":"/post/hello-world/","section":"post","summary":"Nothing more than a hello-world.","tags":["Example"],"title":"Hello, World!","type":"post"},{"authors":[""],"categories":[],"content":"Let’s be honest about this. Python is great, but managing multiple python versions \u0026amp; dependencies across different projects is not. As a professional data engineer and university professor, I would like a reliable python installation method that allows me to keep each project\u0026rsquo;s dependencies isolated and does not introduce extra complexity to the management process. There are two candidates:\n (Close enough) Dockerizing everything! This approach works great on an engineering environment but introduces extra complexity on an academic context. (Winner) Using pyenv and venv. Keeps everything \u0026ldquo;python friendly\u0026rdquo; without introducing foreign ideas.   \nYou should probably know about Python Poetry as a complementary tool (read more here). Poetry is great if you are actively developing python tooling and packages. I will update this post with installation/usage instructions, ~eventually. Until then, let's keep it simple.  Prerequisites For MacOS/Unix users, a regular terminal with git installed should work fine.\nFor Windowns users, one of the following is recommended:\n  Git Bash - recommended for entry-level users.  WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)  Both users should have git installed and configured on their preferred terminal.\nPyEnv Installation: 3 Easy Steps STEP 1: Install PyEnv Open a terminal and execute the following command:\n$ curl -L https://rhdzmota.com/code/pyenv.sh | bash -s -- install   That command will install pyenv in the root directory.  STEP 2: Configure in your terminal Add pyenv to the path, configured via your terminal. Execute the following command to detect which shell you are using:\n$ echo $SHELL    If you are using Git Bash or /usr/bin/bash, run the following:\n Execute: echo 'export PATH=\u0026quot;$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH\u0026quot;' \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.bashrc Reload: source ~/.bashrc    If you are using /usr/bin/zsh, run the following:\n Execute: echo 'export PATH=\u0026quot;$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH\u0026quot;' \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.zshrc Reload: source ~/.zshrc    STEP 3: Verify installation Test your installation by running:\n$ pyenv help  Should output something similar to:\nUsage: pyenv \u0026lt;command\u0026gt; [\u0026lt;args\u0026gt;] Some useful pyenv commands are: commands List all available pyenv commands local Set or show the local application-specific Python version global Set or show the global Python version shell Set or show the shell-specific Python version install Install a Python version using python-build uninstall Uninstall a specific Python version rehash Rehash pyenv shims (run this after installing executables version Show the current Python version and its origin versions List all Python versions available to pyenv which Display the full path to an executable whence List all Python versions that contain the given executable See `pyenv help \u0026lt;command\u0026gt;' for information on a specific command. For full documentation, see: https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win#readme  Python Versions \u0026amp; Installation The beauty of pyenv is that it allows us to easily install multiple python versions. As a recommendation, I usually install the latest databricks long-term support runtime (LTS) recommended python version. At the time, this is the 3.8.8 version.\nInstall multiple python versions Let\u0026rsquo;s install the recomended python versions for the following databricks runtimes:\n 7.3 LTS Runtime: 3.7.5 Python 9.1 LTS Runtime: 3.8.8 Python  We can easily do this by running the following:\n pyenv install 3.7.5 pyenv install 3.8.8  Set the global and local default version to 3.7.5:\n pyenv global 3.7.5 - referes to the python version that should be used globally. It\u0026rsquo;s used as a fallback when the local configuration is not set. pyenv local 3.7.5 - referes to the \u0026ldquo;local\u0026rdquo; python version that should be used at a \u0026ldquo;directory\u0026rdquo; level. You can set each directory to a different local python version.  Show all installed versions with: pyenv versions\n The * indicates which python version is being referenced in the curent location.  Running python commands You can run python through pyenv as following:\n$ pyenv exec python \u0026lt;command\u0026gt;   Example 1: pyenv exec python --version Example 2: pyenv exec python -c 'print(\u0026quot;Hello, world.\u0026quot;)'  I strongly recommend using python\u0026rsquo;s venv (virtual environment) module to manage python dependencies. A good practice is to create an independent venv on each project to:\n Enable using different python versions per project when needed. Isolate dependencies and avoid any possible mismatch or incompatibilities across projects.  Once you are on a project directory, run the following to create a virtualenv:\n$ pyenv exec python -m venv venv   Expected output: a new directory called venv in the root of the project.  You can activate the virutal environemnt with the following commands:\n MacOS/Unix users: source venv/bin/activate Windows users: source venv/Scripts/activate  Once you activate the venv, you should be able to use python directly in the terminal:\n$ python --version  Congratulations! You are now ready to go.\nWhen working with git, do not add/commit the venv folder into the repository. You can make git to ignore this directory by creating a .gitignore file with a single line containing: venv. Example of a more complex python gitignore file here.\n  Usage - Cheat Sheet  Set the local python version (relative to current directory)  $ pyenv local X.Y.Z   Create a python virtual environment via pyenv  $ pyenv exec python -m venv venv    Activate/Deactivate virtualenv:\n Activate:  Windows users: source venv/Scripts/activate Everyone else: source venv/bin/activate   Deactivate: deactivate    Install requirements file:\n  $ pip install -r requirements.txt  ","date":1645394072,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645396469,"objectID":"4d3d5d4ded910cc3c9d49b9218a1108c","permalink":"/post/the-best-way-to-install-python/","publishdate":"2022-02-20T21:54:32Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-best-way-to-install-python/","section":"post","summary":"A reliable guide to install and manage multiple python versions on multiple operative systems","tags":["Setup"],"title":"The *best* way to install Python","type":"post"},{"authors":[""],"categories":[],"content":"The Academic Theme for Hugo allows you to easily create a website using markdown and/or jupyter files. This blog-post is just a personal test, but might be useful for beginners wanting to create their site.\nSetup Go to a working fork of the academic-kickstart github repository and fork the repository. Note that the version I provide on my github is compatible with the instructions on this blogpost. You can try forking the latest academic-kickstart github repository but be aware you might have to use another hugo version than the one provided on this guide.\nNow download the content with:\n$ mkdir my-site \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ wget -O - https://github.com/github-username/academic-kickstart/tarball/master | \\ tar xz -C my-site --strip-components 1  Replace my-site with the name of the repository that will contain your site\u0026rsquo;s code (optional) and github-username with your github username (or use rhdzmota if you didn\u0026rsquo;t fork the repo).\nInstall hugo (select your version here). For debian-based distributions:\n$ sudo apt install wget \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ wget -O hugo.deb 'https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.55.6/hugo_extended_0.55.6_Linux-64bit.deb' \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ sudo dpkg -i hugo.deb  Note that academic version 4.3.1+ requires hugo-extended 0.55.6+.\nVerify your installation by running: hugo version.\nNow enter your site\u0026rsquo;s directory and create the git-repository:\n$ cd my-site \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ rm -rf themes/academic .gitmodules \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git init \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git submodule add https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic themes/academic  You should be able to preview the site with: hugo serve -D\nFor now on, feel free to configure your site. You can see a live example here with the github code here.\nPublishing with github pages Add the following line anywhere on config/_default/config.toml:\npublishDir = \u0026quot;docs\u0026quot;  Now when running hugo on the commandline, a docs directory will appear. This directory contains a set of static files that can be directly published to github pages.\nJust configure your repository in github and push into master. More documentation here.

Table of Contents  Code Essay Report Exercise Data Entry   Code A coding homework represents a complete and functional application solving a particular problem or implementing a business logic. The students should follow the coding best practices of the language being used.\nStyle guide by language:\n  Python style guide  Scala style guide - EPFL  Scala style guide - Databricks  Formatting tools:\n  Black for Python  Scalariform code formatter  A complete code-homework should contain both in-code documentation, documentation files, and tests.\n Total points: 25  Essay The number of words in the essay should satisfy the following constraint:\n$$700 \\leq words \\leq 1000$$\nStudents should follow the \u0026ldquo;five-paragraph essay\u0026rdquo; format, which consists of three principal components:\n Introduction - The principal purpose of the introduction is to expose the thesis statement explicitly. An effective introductory paragraph usually begins with a hook to grab the reader\u0026rsquo;s attention. This might be a personal anecdote, relevant statistics, or a quote. After that, the writer should move on to a clear, one-sentence thesis statement. Body - A good essay usually contains roughly three body paragraphs. The first sentence of these paragraphs is known as the topic sentence and should provide an argument in favor of the thesis. Body paragraphs make use of examples, supporting evidence, statistics, and citations. To ensure continuity, you might want to use a \u0026ldquo;transition phrase\u0026rdquo; to connect different paragraphs (e.g., \u0026ldquo;moreover\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;on the other hand\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;by contrast\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;furthermore\u0026rdquo;). Conclusion - This paragraph should start with a \u0026ldquo;concluding transition\u0026rdquo; and briefly recap on the main arguments of the essay. Lastly, it should restate the thesis statement.  You can read more recommendations here.\nConsider the following aesthetic hints:\n Are your sentences elegant and careful? Have you chosen each word properly? Does the sentence say what it is supposed to say? Do your paragraphs constitute the elaboration of a single idea? Are they sufficiently comprehensive and concise? Does the essay succeed as a unit? Does it make an identifiable and intelligent statement?  The grading of the essay is simple:\n    +3 +1.5 +0     Intro and thesis statement Clear and concise; directly related to the topic; Engaging hook. Clear but slightly unrelated; mediocre hook. Vague and unclear.   Body and topic sentences Main argument of paragraph is identifiable and in the first sentence. Hard to distinguish main argument Vague and unclear.   Supporting evidence Use of evidence, examples, citations, etc. Regular use of supporting evidence. Little to none usage.   Conclusion Correct transition; recap of main arguments; restates the thesis. Slightly unaligned with the rest of the essay. Fails to provide closure.   Grammar Free of grammatical errors. Few grammatical errors. Frequent grammatical errors.    Total points: 15\nGrammar examination includes, but is not limited to:\n Spelling, punctuation, and syntax. Correct use of sentences (e.g., no sentence fragments or run-on sentences). Consistent verb tense usage.  If you are interested in improving your writing skills, consider reading:\n The Grammarly blog. Contains relevant posts such as the top 10 grammatical mistakes and 15 easy steps to improve writing. The 10-step process for stronger writing from BigThink.  Report The data-analysis reports must be done using Python in rmarkdown or jupyter notebook / lab. The final deliverable should be a PDF file with the related source (.Rmd or .ipynb).\nThe minimum structure of the report should include:\n Executive summary - Explain the problem, the dataset, and your findings. Body - The body contains the development and technical aspects of the report. It\u0026rsquo;s usually \u0026ldquo;question oriented\u0026rdquo;. The following sections are expected:  Data - Description of the data source, format, and shape. For each relevant variable, the type should be identified. How does the data quality looks? Does it includes some missing values? Univariable analysis - Analyze the distribution of the target variable. Does the target variable follows a normal distribution? Should we apply a custom transformation? Multivariable analysis - Identify the relevant variables in the dataset. This can be done by a correlation analysis. Visualize results (e.g., correlation matrix, scatterplot, box-plots). What\u0026rsquo;s the distribution of the related variables? What variables do you think can be used as predictors?   Conclusions - Closing paragraph that contains the most relevant insights of the exploratory analysis. Appendix - Any other resource not directly related to the main analysis but of further interest. This might include:  A more in-depth description of a technical procedure. Detailed output of a process. Mathematical demonstrations. Supporting code.        +2 +1 +0     Report structure Follows the minimal structure. NA Missing structure.   Data visualization Correct visualization and formatting. Correct visualization but lack of formatting. Confusing visualization.   Technical proficiency Statistical proficiency; efficient coding and good practices. Correct but inefficient implementation.
