An effective introductory paragraph usually begins with a hook to grab the reader\u0026rsquo;s attention. This might be a personal anecdote, relevant statistics, or a quote. After that, the writer should move on to a clear, one-sentence thesis statement. Body - A good essay usually contains roughly three body paragraphs. The first sentence of these paragraphs is known as the topic sentence and should provide an argument in favor of the thesis. Body paragraphs make use of examples, supporting evidence, statistics, and citations. To ensure continuity, you might want to use a \u0026ldquo;transition phrase\u0026rdquo; to connect different paragraphs (e.g., \u0026ldquo;moreover\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;on the other hand\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;by contrast\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;furthermore\u0026rdquo;). Conclusion - This paragraph should start with a \u0026ldquo;concluding transition\u0026rdquo; and briefly recap on the main arguments of the essay. Lastly, it should restate the thesis statement.  You can read more recommendations here.\nConsider the following aesthetic hints:\nAre your sentences elegant and careful? Have you chosen each word properly? Does the sentence say what it is supposed to say? Do your paragraphs constitute the elaboration of a single idea? Are they sufficiently comprehensive and concise? Does the essay succeed as a unit? Does it make an identifiable and intelligent statement?  The grading of the essay is simple:\n    +3 +1.5 +0     Intro and thesis statement Clear and concise; directly related to the topic; Engaging hook. Clear but slightly unrelated; mediocre hook. Vague and unclear.   Body and topic sentences Main argument of paragraph is identifiable and in the first sentence. Hard to distinguish main argument Vague and unclear.   Supporting evidence Use of evidence, examples, citations, etc. Regular use of supporting evidence. Little to none usage.   Conclusion Correct transition; recap of main arguments; restates the thesis. Slightly unaligned with the rest of the essay. Fails to provide closure.   Grammar Free of grammatical errors. Few grammatical errors. Frequent grammatical errors.    Total points: 15\nGrammar examination includes, but is not limited to:\n Spelling, punctuation, and syntax. Correct use of sentences (e.g., no sentence fragments or run-on sentences). Consistent verb tense usage.  If you are interested in improving your writing skills, consider reading:\n The Grammarly blog. Contains relevant posts such as the top 10 grammatical mistakes and 15 easy steps to improve writing. The 10-step process for stronger writing from BigThink.\n  Report The data-analysis reports must be done using Python in rmarkdown or jupyter notebook / lab. The final deliverable should be a PDF file with the related source (.Rmd or .ipynb).\nThe minimum structure of the report should include:\n Executive summary - Explain the problem, the dataset, and your findings. Body - The body contains the development and technical aspects of the report. It\u0026rsquo;s usually \u0026ldquo;question oriented\u0026rdquo;. The following sections are expected:  Data - Description of the data source, format, and shape. For each relevant variable, the type should be identified. How does the data quality looks? Does it includes some missing values? Univariable analysis - Analyze the distribution of the target variable. Does the target variable follows a normal distribution? Should we apply a custom transformation? Multivariable analysis - Identify the relevant variables in the dataset. This can be done by a correlation analysis. Visualize results (e.g., correlation matrix, scatterplot, box-plots). What\u0026rsquo;s the distribution of the related variables? What variables do you think can be used as predictors?  Conclusions - Closing paragraph that contains the most relevant insights of the exploratory analysis. Appendix - Any other resource not directly related to the main analysis but of further interest. This might include:  A more in-depth description of a technical procedure. Detailed output of a process. Mathematical demonstrations. Supporting code.       +2 +1 +0     Report structure Follows the minimal structure. NA Missing structure.   Data visualization Correct visualization and formatting. Correct visualization but lack of formatting. Confusing visualization.   Technical proficiency Statistical proficiency; efficient coding and good practices. Correct but inefficient implementation. Wrong implementation.   Analytical reasoning Outstanding analysis; excellent written communication skills. Mediocre written communication and analysis. Fails to demonstrate analytical reasoning.

Note that the version I provide on my github is compatible with the instructions on this blogpost. You can try forking the latest academic-kickstart github repository but be aware you might have to use another hugo version than the one provided on this guide.\nNow download the content with:\n$ mkdir my-site \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ wget -O - https://github.com/github-username/academic-kickstart/tarball/master | \\ tar xz -C my-site --strip-components 1  Replace my-site with the name of the repository that will contain your site\u0026rsquo;s code (optional) and github-username with your github username (or use rhdzmota if you didn\u0026rsquo;t fork the repo).\nInstall hugo (select your version here). For debian-based distributions:\n$ sudo apt install wget \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ wget -O hugo.deb 'https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.55.6/hugo_extended_0.55.6_Linux-64bit.deb' \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ sudo dpkg -i hugo.deb  Note that academic version 4.3.1+ requires hugo-extended 0.55.6+.\nVerify your installation by running: hugo version.\nNow enter your site\u0026rsquo;s directory and create the git-repository:\n$ cd my-site \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ rm -rf themes/academic .gitmodules \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git init \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git submodule add https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic themes/academic  You should be able to preview the site with: hugo serve -D\nFor now on, feel free to configure your site. You can see a live example here with the github code here.\nPublishing with github pages Add the following line anywhere on config/_default/config.toml:\npublishDir = \u0026quot;docs\u0026quot;  Now when running hugo on the commandline, a docs directory will appear. This directory contains a set of static files that can be directly published to github pages.\nJust configure your repository in github and push into master. More documentation here.
