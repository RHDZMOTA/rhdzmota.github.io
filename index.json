For debian-based distributions:\n$ sudo apt install wget \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ wget -O hugo.deb 'https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.55.6/hugo_extended_0.55.6_Linux-64bit.deb' \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ sudo dpkg -i hugo.deb  Note that academic version 4.3.1+ requires hugo-extended 0.55.6+.\nVerify your installation by running: hugo version.\nNow enter your site\u0026rsquo;s directory and create the git-repository:\n$ cd my-site \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ rm -rf themes/academic .gitmodules \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git init \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git submodule add https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic themes/academic  You should be able to preview the site with: hugo serve -D\nFor now on, feel free to configure your site. You can see a live example here with the github code here.\nPublishing with github pages Add the following line anywhere on config/_default/config.toml:\npublishDir = \u0026quot;docs\u0026quot;  Now when running hugo con the commandline, a docs directory will appear. This directory contains a set of static files that can be directly published to github pages.\nJust configure your repository in github and push into master. More documentation here. Integration with custom domains guide here and here.\n","date":1561928160,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561928160,"objectID":"0a654315cc2e44035ff4fabf3e1852f0","permalink":"/post/creating-your-own-site-with-academic-hugo/","publishdate":"2019-06-30T20:56:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/creating-your-own-site-with-academic-hugo/","section":"post","summary":"This is a test post  \u0026 documentation on how to install academic hugo on a debian-based linux distro.","tags":["Setup"],"title":"Creating your own site with Academic Hugo","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548441000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548441000,"objectID":"4e42266fb895fc8f37b0e8138d81cb30","permalink":"/talk/end-to-end-ml-with-apache-spark/","publishdate":"2019-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/end-to-end-ml-with-apache-spark/","section":"talk","summary":"From data-science to engineering with Apache Spark.","tags":[],"title":"End-To-End ML with Apache Spark","type":"talk"}]
